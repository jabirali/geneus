### Installation
For up-to-date installation instructions, see the [README on GitHub](https://github.com/jabirali/geneus).

Note that the tutorial herein uses [Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) for data visualization, so it may be easier to follow the examples if you have that installed.  If you are unfamiliar with Gnuplot, take a look at [this page](http://www.gnuplotting.org/) for examples of how to generate publication-quality plots with Gnuplot.
